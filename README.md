# LeetcodeClearer

Problem: When revisiting a Leetcode question I have done before, I have to look away from my solution while trying to clear the solution to its default contents, to prevent spoiling the solution.

Solution: Chrome Extension that adds a hotkey (CTRL-SHIFT-E) to Leetcode which clears the question instantly.
